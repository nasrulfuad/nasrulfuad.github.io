### 11. Install Docker and Docker Compose

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure
so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage
of Docker‚Äôs methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running
it in production. read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. With Compose, you can create a YAML file to define
the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates gnupg lsb-release
```

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
